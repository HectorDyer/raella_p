Thank You For Your Patience

​
"No sun to know days, no moon to know months, no sense to know years.
From what tumbles out of us, old words that had been lying inside us as if they were dead, we build stories."
​
Produced by Hackney Showroom, this one-person theatre piece is directed by Sam Curtis Lindsay, with dramaturgical support from Nina Lyndon.
​
"A compelling, unsettling work which interweaves different narrative strands to explore the impossible environmental legacies we are creating for future generations."
